<summary>  Data Cleansing Steps </summary>
In a single query, we performed the following operations and generate a new table named clean_weekly_sales:

- Added week_number as the second column for each week_date value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2, etc.
- Added month_number with the calendar month for each week_date value as the 3rd column
- Added a calendar_year column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values
- Added a new column called age_band after the original segment column using the following mapping on the number inside the segment value

| segment| age_band|
| -----------| ---------|
| 1 | Young Adults |
| 2 | Middle Aged |
| 3 or 4 | Retirees|

- Added a new demographic column using the following mapping for the first letter in the segment values:

| segment| demographic |
| -----------| ---------|
| F | Couples  |
| C | Families |
